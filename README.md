- Use command: `python manage.py observation_plan_scout`.

**Parsing the data:**
- It searches the *data_source* folder looking for new files. Then parses the data in these files and saves them into the database.
- Use command: `python manage.py report_parser`.

**Showing the data on the web page:**
- Homepage shows what is the current target of the Webb's observation.
